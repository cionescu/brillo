# Change Log

## 2.0.0.rc1
Upgrade to AWS SDK 3.0, reduce dependence to S3 specifically.

Support ERB in brillo.yaml

Support alternative primary keys to "id"

Fix bug where Brillo breaks when using the Octopus gem

## 1.3.1
Disable query cacheing to reduce memory growth over time.

## 1.3.0

Fix Postgres load failing because of existing connection

## 1.2.2
Fixed initializer. `Brillo.configure` pre-initialization will now work.

Moved verification of config to post app initialization.

## 1.2.1
Support S3 config [via your environment](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby#configuration). To configure via the environment, just leave your `Brillo.config.transfer_config.{access_key_id,secret_access_key}` blank.

## 1.1.4
Fix loading a postgres database with a password set.

## 1.1.3
Fix bug in S3 upload path. Files were previously uploading to their local system path in S3. I.e. `bucket-name/my/rails/app/tmp/my-app-scrubbed.dmp.gz`.

## 1.1.2
Set us-east-1 as the default region, because this is S3s default and can be accessed from other regions.

## 1.1.1
Fixed postgres sequence not being set to MAX(id).

## 1.1.0
**New**
- **BREAKING** Brillo used to support loading your credentials from a YAML file at `/etc/ec2_secure_env.yml`
but no longer does. It is now your responsibility to ensure the credentials are in the environment Brillo
runs in.
- Removed the dependency on the AWS Timkay CLI, instead using the AWS gem.
- Added support for configuring all S3 parameters in Ruby land

**Fixed**
- Fix mysql exec when no host specified
- Fix postgres exec when no host specified
- Fix postgres adapter reference
